In this short RPG demo, you'll generate a character and fight two kinds of enemies.

As of now, character creation only allows to pick a name, then get randomized values (similar to IV's). Based on IV count, you get a sentence stating how your character is.

Future plans could imply character classes based on stats, as well as a character class picker.

Current functionalities:
*Attacks can miss, hit, or crit.
*NPC picks whether to heal or attack based on situation.
*Random Boss NPC might appear, encounter is not mandatory.
*Character levels up, increasing stats randomly.
*When Character levels up, current enemy levels up as well.

To be added in the future:
*Character classes.
*Character / enemy groups.
*Manually distribute stats.
